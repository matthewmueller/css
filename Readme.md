## Similar

- [tdewolfe/parse](https://github.com/tdewolff/parse): Most popular. A low-level streaming grammar. Doesn't parse selectors. Looks primarily intended for minification, rather than codemods.
- [benpjohnson/css](https://github.com/benbjohnson/css): Almost what we want. Doesn't parse selectors. Hasn't been updated in 10 years.
- [gorilla/css](https://github.com/gorilla/css): Just a scanner, there's no parser.
